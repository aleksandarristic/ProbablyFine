# Audit Log

## 2026-02-16

- Initialized project-management directory `.project-tasks/`.
- Added roadmap, prioritized backlog, current sprint definition, and open questions.
- Captured the new target architecture:
  - per-repo `.probablyfine/` contract
  - deterministic multi-stage processing pipeline
  - dated cache and report audit trails
  - optional Codex/LLM usage only for hard-to-determinize tasks
  - multi-repo wrapper with sequential/parallel execution modes
- Added repository-level `README.md` documenting project purpose, `.probablyfine` contract, architecture direction, and task tracking references.
- Added repository-level `AGENTS.md` with project working agreements (determinism-first, code-vs-skill boundary, and required task/audit updates).
- Added starter template bundle at `templates/probablyfine-starter/.probablyfine/` with `context.json`, `config.json`, cache root placeholder, and sample report snapshots.
- Updated `README.md` with bootstrap instructions for copying the `.probablyfine` starter into target repositories.
- Marked task `PF-091` as `DONE` in `.project-tasks/backlog.md`.
- Reworked `.project-tasks/backlog.md` from table format to human-readable section/card markdown while preserving IDs, dependencies, priorities, and acceptance criteria.
- Reworked `.project-tasks/open-questions.md` from table format to human-readable section/card markdown.
- Updated `.project-tasks/README.md` to define the new non-table backlog style.
- Implemented `scripts/probablyfine-triage/context_creator.py` as deterministic interactive utility for creating `.probablyfine/context.json`.
- Added utility usage docs to `scripts/probablyfine-triage/README.md` and root `README.md`.
- Marked task `PF-060` as `DONE` in `.project-tasks/backlog.md`.
- Updated `.project-tasks/current-sprint.md` to note `PF-060` as completed ahead of original scope.
- Repackaged runtime code into `src/probablyfine/triage/` and added Python packaging metadata in `pyproject.toml`.
- Added `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`.
- Added console entry points: `probablyfine-triage`, `probablyfine-triage-legacy`, and `probablyfine-context`.
- Converted files in `scripts/probablyfine-triage/` into compatibility wrappers to preserve script-based execution.
- Updated docs for package-first usage and install/run commands.
- Marked task `PF-092` as `DONE` and aligned current sprint notes.

## 2026-02-21

- Completed `PF-041` threat intel stage (EPSS/KEV) with deterministic fallback behavior.
- Threat intel stage now emits `threat_intel.json` even when fetch fails, preserving bounded deterministic downstream scoring (`E:X` when intel unknown).

- Updated `.project-tasks/current-sprint.md` to record `PF-041` as completed in scope.

  - `scripts/probablyfine-triage/validate_starter_contracts.py`
- Updated `README.md` and `.agents/skills/probablyfine-triage/references/contracts.md` with schema/contract references and validation command.
- Marked tasks `PF-001`, `PF-002`, and `PF-003` as `DONE`.
- Updated current sprint progress notes to include `PF-001`/`PF-002`/`PF-003` completions.
- Implemented scanner wrapper CLI in `src/probablyfine/scanner.py` with multi-repo path input and per-repo pipeline execution.
- Added scanner compatibility wrapper at `scripts/probablyfine-triage/scanner.py` and console script entry point `probablyfine-scan`.
- Implemented deterministic `.probablyfine` discovery/validation in `src/probablyfine/contracts.py` and reused it from `scripts/probablyfine-triage/validate_starter_contracts.py`.
- Updated scanner/CLI docs in `README.md`, `scripts/probablyfine-triage/README.md`, and `.agents/skills/probablyfine-triage/references/cli.md`.
- Marked tasks `PF-010` and `PF-020` as `DONE`.
- Added `--mode sequential|parallel` and `--workers` support to scanner (`PF-011`).
- Added per-repo run manifest emission at `.probablyfine/reports/<date>/run-manifest-<run-id>.json` with run metadata (`PF-013`).
- Updated scanner documentation and CLI references for parallel mode and manifest outputs.
- Marked tasks `PF-011` and `PF-013` as `DONE` and aligned current sprint tracking.
- Added scanner repo-list ingestion via `--repo-list` for newline-delimited repo path files (`PF-070`).
- Added explicit resilient orchestration summary output with optional `--summary-json` containing per-repo statuses (`PF-012`).
- Preserved fail-forward behavior: scanner continues processing remaining repos when individual repos fail validation or pipeline execution.
- Updated scanner docs/CLI references for `--repo-list` and `--summary-json`.
- Marked tasks `PF-012` and `PF-070` as `DONE` and aligned sprint tracking.
- Added bounded repo batching/queueing to scanner via `--batch-size` (`PF-071`).
- Scanner now processes repos in deterministic batches while preserving per-repo result ordering.
- Updated scanner docs/CLI references for batching mode.
- Marked task `PF-071` as `DONE` and aligned current sprint tracking.
- Implemented typed config loader in `src/probablyfine/config_loader.py` and integrated scanner validation path (`PF-021`).
- Scanner now fails clearly when typed config load fails or deterministic mode is disabled.
- Updated `README.md` reference for typed config loader.
- Marked task `PF-021` as `DONE` and aligned current sprint tracking.
- Implemented deterministic ECR image reference resolution for tag/digest config inputs (`PF-022`).
- Scanner now validates/resolves ECR image references before run and records normalized resolved refs in per-repo run manifests.
- Updated `README.md` with config loader and ECR resolver references.
- Marked task `PF-022` as `DONE` and aligned sprint tracking.
- Implemented Dependabot collector with GitHub API fetch + dated raw cache artifact output (`PF-030`).
- Added deterministic local override for Dependabot collector via `PROBABLYFINE_DEPENDABOT_FILE`.
- Scanner now feeds pipeline from cached Dependabot raw artifact path and records collector metadata in run manifest.
- Marked task `PF-030` as `DONE` and aligned sprint tracking.
- Implemented ECR collector with `describe_image_scan_findings` API path and dated raw cache artifact output (`PF-031`).
- Added deterministic local override for ECR collector via `PROBABLYFINE_ECR_FILE` with fallback to local `ecr_findings.json`.
- Scanner now feeds pipeline from cached ECR raw artifact path and records ECR collector metadata in run manifest.
- Marked task `PF-031` as `DONE` and aligned sprint tracking.
- Implemented cache audit trail writer artifacts at `.probablyfine/cache/<date>/cache-audit-<run-id>.json` (`PF-051`).
- Cache audit payload now records collector inputs/metadata and derived/report artifact paths per run.
- Updated `README.md` to document cache audit output location.
- Marked task `PF-051` as `DONE` and aligned sprint tracking.
- Implemented deterministic bounded retry/timeout/rate-limit controls for Dependabot and ECR collectors (`PF-032`).
- Added configurable collector control env vars for attempts/timeouts/sleep intervals with bounded validation.
- Updated scanner docs and CLI references for collector retry/timeout controls.
- Marked task `PF-032` as `DONE` and aligned sprint tracking.
- Completed deterministic normalize/dedupe stage for correlated Dependabot + ECR findings (`PF-040`).
- Hardened normalization determinism by selecting CVSS base vectors order-independently during merge.
- Added focused normalization tests at `tests/test_normalize_findings.py` for dedupe/sorting and order-stable correlation behavior.
- Ran offline pipeline smoke test with local fixtures to verify stage artifacts are emitted (`normalized_findings.json`, `threat_intel.json`, `env_overrides.json`, report outputs).
- Updated docs in `README.md` and skill-stage references for normalization output behavior.
- Marked task `PF-040` as `DONE` and aligned sprint tracking.
