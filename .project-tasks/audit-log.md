# Audit Log

## 2026-02-16

- Initialized project-management directory `.project-tasks/`.
- Added roadmap, prioritized backlog, current sprint definition, and open questions.
- Captured the new target architecture:
  - per-repo `.probablyfine/` contract
  - deterministic multi-stage processing pipeline
  - dated cache and report audit trails
  - optional Codex/LLM usage only for hard-to-determinize tasks
  - multi-repo wrapper with sequential/parallel execution modes
- Added repository-level `README.md` documenting project purpose, `.probablyfine` contract, architecture direction, and task tracking references.
- Added repository-level `AGENTS.md` with project working agreements (determinism-first, code-vs-skill boundary, and required task/audit updates).
